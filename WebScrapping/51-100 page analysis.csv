There are a lot of different aspects of federal support that Deloitte provides, so there is something that could appeal to everyone. Deloitte's benefits are a differentiator for me, the well-being subsidy is first rate and the PTO policy is very flexible, I have never had an issue getting time off when I want or need it - people here are very understanding of work-life balance. To that point, I think they navigated flexible work well throughout the pandemic and did a really good job making sure employees were comfortable. I still work from home (very common amongst the people I speak with regularly) and Deloitte has done a lot in making it a comfortable experience.","This is specific to the Government and Public Sector (GPS) practice, but I personally find the work to be dull. The work is very mission-driven and has real world impacts to people across the US (and world), which I really like. However, the scale of the projects sometimes feel so large that it doesn't really feel like you are making as much of an impact.

247,"Might be good benefits in long term, no pros in short term.","Hard work or knowledge or skill doesn't help: If you're not a smart/smooth talker, you have to be a brown-noser to survive at Deloitte. If you're a brown-noser, you can get away with anything.
Consulting Job expectation is like an old-school Sales Job: If you can sell crap packaged in a beautiful deck (that's the adjective a manager specifically uses to describe powerpoint slides: beautiful) and say a barely coherent story while presenting the decks with extreme confidence, you would be hailed as the best employee by your manager. If you can't beautify powerpoint slides and sell crap, forget about it, you'll be demoted/released from project and every manager who wants to take you on the next project will be forewarned by your current manager. Amazing example of negativity networking.
Mentoring: New hires are neither respected nor recognized. There's no real mentoring or direction or guidance provided for new hires on the next steps in the project etc., instead you get more of the same sales talk during your mentoring sessions, which is completely useless. Though, this sales talk does include veiled verbal threats reminding you of the consequence of challenging the performance rating provided.
Gender Bias: If you end up working with a male chauvinistic manager, you can forget about growth, gender bias is quite prevalent.
DE&I: Diversity, Equality and Inclusion exists only in policies, not practiced in reality.
Defensive approach: Documentation created or maintained during the project lifecycle is only used for defending Deloitte, not actually helpful to the customers. More defensive documentation than customer-centric/useful.
Leading Practices: In the name of industry leading practices, Deloitte recommends impractical solutions to the customers. These solutions are formulated in such a way that Deloitte internal teams can get away with doing minimal work and they save resource costs. These result in complicated solutions that make the customer's life harder than it was while they used their legacy applications/solutions.",Consultant,3,Aug,2022
