Especially post-Covid19 where everybody is working from home and has a ton of free time. During this period a lot has been exposed about Consulting as a business and how bullsh!t it mostly is. Fortune 500 firms are struggling amidst the largest credit crisis we have ever had, and there is an incredible amount of demand for expensive consultants who are paid to sound like they know what they are talking about and make PowerPoints (or spreadsheets if you're one of the luckier ones on a more 'involved' client project). All of this amidst the lowest employment rate we are seeing across the western economies; Deloitte will hire anyone and their refrigerator with this current job climate. They had to give a 'market adjustment' to salaries across the board just to try and keep people. This was unfortunately no more than a 10%-15% bump, which sounds great. But after inflation and taxes, I have basically taken a pay CUT.
 
I am giving this company a 4 star review because I believe it deserves it for the most part. It is filled with great people, and I met some fantastic partners who were genuinely concerned with figuring out how they can be better in these unprecedented times. But, unless you are ready to commit your LIFE to this company in a time when you can be paid more money by your second cousin's work-from-home small insurance company, or perhaps ideally, whatever it is you REALLY want to spend your life doing, I can not recommend working here as a first big boy/big girl job.

The few old school Deloitte managers and Senior managers, directors etc.. are the best people in that company, but these are few and apart.
Don't get me wrong some people thrive in this environment!","Corporate culture at it's finest. Office politics can be horrendous if you are not connected. Seniors can have a chip on their shoulder and will take it out on you. You will get sympathy if you are an attractive female otherwise you are mostly on your own. 100 hours workweek as a salary employee don't expect to get payed for OT.

Tremendous exposure to growth opportunities, knowledge, exceptional performers.","70+ hour work weeks are very common, especially at the Senior Manager level. Stress is shockingly high, and is worsened by leadership that will routinely assign tasks (trivial and massive) to people with little/no notice, and with no regard for current workload. Junior personnel are expected to participate in sales activities (proposal writing, contract solicitations) IN ADDITION to working full-time, often pushing work hours into the 80+ per week range. Toxicity at the Partner/Principal/Managing Director is pervasive and leaves junior folks in their purview with very little latitude to report issues, as PPMD's routinely control every aspect of career mobility (promotions, raises, etc.) at Deloitte.",Manager,1,Mar,2022

- Ability to work remote","If you aren't from a target school, you will get put on bad projects with poor opportunities. This leads to sub-optimal performance compared to the hires that Deloitte values whom get to pick their projects so they align with their strengths. If you aren't from a target school, you are a basically a ""second rate citizen"" of Deloitte. You come in at a low salary and never catch up regardless of how capable you are and are treated like a workhorse rather than the company investing in you. The organization is so big that there is no way of breaking out of the buckets that they place you in. Especially hard in the current environment where there are zero days in office, your teams will be spread across cities, and you will likely never meet your practitioners.",Consultant,15,Mar,2022
