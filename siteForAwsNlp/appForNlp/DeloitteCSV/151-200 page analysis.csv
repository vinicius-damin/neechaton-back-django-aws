There is not enough staffing on any of them and so those that ARE staffed on projects have to pick up the slack and take on extra work.

- Beyond like super dry trainings that you won’t retain well because there’s no practical application opportunities immediately, there’s like no training for this job. All the trainings you have to do when you join are for tax accountants and have nothing to do with what your job will require.

It's a definition of a toxic workplace. Managers can lie to you to to make you accept a project which can turn out to be completely irrelevant to your skills and interests and they will never release you. If you complain - expect retaliation through your performance review. They do have HR process for cases above, but most people don't want to deal with it or are afraid to get themselves into bigger trouble. This is why they have such huge employee turnover. They try to retain people by offering signing bonuses that you have to pay back if you leave before reaching 2-year tenure, so some people choose to stay just to avoid this penalty. Another terrible thing - they don't deliver anything useful to clients, you can spend a whole year on a project without being able to follow any best practices or delivering any meaningful work - the way it works is they agree to anything clients say without actually CONSULTING them and then keep telling everything is going well (client don't usually check the work) and continue charging them - everything is about money only.

178,Deloitte is a big company and has a lot of opportunity to get exposure and credentials for someone trying to make an impact to their career. I gained a valuable credential that significantly enhanced my career and earnings potential. Some teams within Deloitte can be a lot of fun to work with.,"Objectively bad benefits, compensation and horrid retirement unless you make the partnership. I worked on a large IT project that was constantly missing milestones because of incompetence, lack of experience, and poor leadership. PPMDs didn't seem to be very present or have much, if any technology experience. There are frankly too many MBAs and consultants instead of experienced professionals. My direct lead was toxic and constantly derailing morning meetings to interrogate me in front of our team among other issues. They later left the project but seemed like a byproduct of Deloitte's ""culture"" as this behavior existed elsewhere in the company. There were also multiple instances of senior employees throwing other people under the bus to cover up large mistakes.

The company itself is a failure from a diversity & inclusion perspective. Deloitte's talent models are basically a discrimination based system where Deloitte Consulting is obviously mostly ivy league types where those from other backgrounds usually end up in Delivery Center or Project Delivery (PDM). PDM is more like being a sub-contractor to Deloitte and you will miss out on many benefits. It's frankly awkward when your colleagues get to go to Deloitte University but you cannot.

Some might read into this as me just not being Deloitte material, and honestly I don't know who would want to embody the leadership I experienced. These failures ultimately showed in the terrible delivery on my project and constant contract turmoil. Outside of the project I was on, I'm sure there are better places to be within Deloitte however I suspect the culture I experienced is present elsewhere.
