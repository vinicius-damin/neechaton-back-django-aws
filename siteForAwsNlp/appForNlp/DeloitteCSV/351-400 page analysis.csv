There are some great leaders, but most people here get promoted to the next level based on their ability to churn out quality work in tight timelines. 

A common saying is the ""nights and weekends"" type of work which means sacrificing family time for work for the firm. Consulting is not a great lifestyle to raise a family. 
 Remote has been difficult and there is a growing norm to always be on. It is common for emails at 12:30 am and all weekend long. The pay is great, but the hours you work are long and probably not very comparable to a decent-paying 9-5 if you looked at it from an hourly rate. There is also not an emphasis on developing people since there is a line out the door to work here. You have to be proactive if you want to be developed.

Being evaluated on a scatterplot of your peers (all of which who have managers that evaluate their talent differently) is really misleading and honestly not helpful to my development.

Having long hours is standard, like most consulting firms. You have to suss out which partners / SMs tend have more intense projects and pursue staffing opportunities accordingly. Even though it has been acknowledged that people are feeling burnt out during the pandemic from constant Zoom meetings, nothing has really changed significantly to fix it.

Also, GSAP is a lot more selective than in the past, even though it's marketed heavily when recruiting candidates.
