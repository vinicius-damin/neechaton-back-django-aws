Perfect example... the actual consulting practice in Deloitte has a program that will help you prepare and pay for your MBA (even if its a $200K M7); In stark contrast, the EFA practice will not provide you with anything. Unlike other roles at Deloitte, the EFA practice does not provide you with hard skills and transferable knowledge (aside from basic Excel... and the ""soft skills"" of sucking up to partners and pumping up their egos).

However, as the time goes on and you begin to progress at the firm, it becomes harder and harder to want to give them your best work and stay in it for the long haul.

This firm will provide you with great experience and exposure to both large and small clients of all industries, and gives you a great opportunity to network with a lot of smart people.","The pay may increase every year, but they always manage to come in slightly below everyone's expectations, even if they brag about it beforehand. It also takes a very small amount of time to realize that no matter what level you're at (with the exception of partner), you are seen as a robotic cog in the corporate machine. From being rewarded with a box of peanuts and raisins after months of working 75+ hour weeks to losing your motivation to provide value; unfortunately, this firm definitely does tend to suck the life and goals out of people. Most people who stay long term (unless they have a burning passion for audit) were just like you and me, but never left and got sucked into the grind. Not to mention, benefits are average at BEST for a company of this size. $48 billion in revenue and all they can muster up is $0.25 to the dollar for 401(k) contributions (u to 6% of your salary), which is worse than any company I have ever personally heard of. It's an extremely passive and cutthroat culture but not in the good way.

The pay is OK, but the benefits are amazing
Tons of variety and freedom to pursue your interests","Once you get to the senior levels, be prepared for old-fashioned corporate American politics. Getting promoted is such a game. You could be performing amazingly well with clients, but you're screwed if your self-promotion game isn't on point with the strangers in your year-end review.

The government sector tends to underpay by a lot. If you're a campus hire, don't expect to make as much as an experienced hire coming in with the same experience later on down the line. They'll pay competitive for them, but have you locked into a pretty lame pay scale progression. I boomeranged (left and came back), bumping my pay above my campus hired peers. 

You have quite a bit of latitude in selecting projects, if the timing works out, but getting on the wrong project and getting ""pigeon-holed"" will destroy your career and promotion ambitions.

Also, you'll need to sacrifice quite a lot to out compete your peers to get that promotion. Got kids and want to see them? Too bad. Most of your peers don't have kids and are able to out compete you on firm contributions (e.g. internal initiatives, proposals, white papers, etc.)",Anonymous Employee,23,Jun,2021

Firstly the culture is hegemonic and there is a prevailing groupthink dynamic. However, there is no immediate harm in going your own way and being yourself, but the people who advance tend to ""drink the Kool-Aid"" and have a similar view for how work should be sold and delivered.
