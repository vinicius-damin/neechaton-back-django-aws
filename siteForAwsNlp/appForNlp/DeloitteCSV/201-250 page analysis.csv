4,"A diverse workforce. Working in Global has allowed me to flex my hours to my liking. Lots of opportunity to get involved in internal projects - many people have been promoted off the back of this.

Once you are a manager/senior consultant equivalent, you get an additional £5,100 cash allowance to use on benefits, or you can take the cash to bump up your salary (taxed)

Honestly the best place I've ever worked and have learned so much here. It's also very easy to move around once you are in the firm.","Promotion cycles are long and only happen once a year (if not in Consulting - twice a year if you are) Feels like you have to jump through hoops or know someone to get the promotion. You also have to be working at the next grade for 12 months before the promotional case can begin so in effect sometimes you are waiting 2 years for it to happen!

The training trip to Deloitte University in Taxes is a great experience, which happen every year or two.

Your work is based on projects and teams, and depends on what project you and your resource manager could find. You will be in trouble if you could not find a project to claim your time. You will never know where you will be working in next project. It maybe in Deloitte's office or clients office which will be 50 miles away from your place.

- There are very few senior designers and those who stick around are not talented or skilled as designers to call themselves senior, they are only good at regular consulting and research but have a fancy title. Deloitte prioritizes clout and titles over actual skill. You will have no one to learn from nor mentor you to become better at that skill.
