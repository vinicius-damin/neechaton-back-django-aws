1,"Good Pay , great work culture","Cant think of any cons as Deloitte, it all depends on who your boss is and what is the nature of the project.",Manager,1,Dec,2022
2,"These folks know exactly what they are doing. They set high standards, and consistently deliver. 
Their project expectations and planning is excellent. The top level management folks are extremely smart and have a great sense of vision and planning. If you go to company social events (which are very frequent by the way), it is quite easy to have conversations with upper management people (Partners). 

Deloitte's hiring pattern is very consistent. For the young starters, they hire smart, well spoken, and subtly aggressive candidates. They have excellent training and knowledge management. They have a well oiled and empowered HR and Tech Support group. Things get done pretty fast. 

Their paid time off program is really great, and pretty straight forward. No messing about.

They have a big social responsibility program that encourages volunteering. It also presents a great opportunity for youngsters to take event organizing responsibilities. This can be very very useful. Once, I volunteered for an event where we painted rooms for an orphanage center. There was a young guy who did the organizing. We were 10-12 people, with 3 senior executives actually doing paintwork. Quite unique. 


I have personally seen that Deloitte's top talents tend to start young, spend a 3-4 years, then take a hiatus to pursue a Graduate Degree (typically an MBA). The firm sometimes re-hires these consultants after their MBA with generous financial incentives. They offer much better packages to folks graduating from top universities. Sometimes they can offer huge joining bonuses. 

I worked in the IT consulting division.They tend to get top-end projects. On projects, the average age seems pretty low.  A lot of 20-somethings, then there are a handful of 30-40 year old people and some senior Management folks.

Beginner salaries can be a bit low. (which is expected. It takes some time to build credibility in the Consulting business)

Overall, a great place to start your professional career. If you pay attention, you will get seasoned very quickly.","Work-life balance can become poor, especially during tight project timelines (This is expected in the Consulting Business). The employees have a significant amount of ""firm-internal"" training and knowledge contribution tasks. There are annual goal expectations. It can get tedious if you continuously work on high demand projects.

There is intense competition, especially during targeted promotion/milestone years. There can be some backstabbing. It's part of the experience. It is not as bad as it sounds, and seems manageable. 

A lot of times, being young and inexperienced has it's flaws. The company has a simple way of seasoning consultants. They get pushed into high pressure situations, and they learn fast, and quickly start managing their own work. But they tend to be blind towards intricate details, especially in complicated IT product implementations. This has an interesting effect. If someone is able to do the hands-on work, everyone else tries to piggy-back on that person for their actual work. The hands-on guy gets overwhelmed, and others try to use him/her as a key resource. 
-- I personally went through a crunch project, and found a number of people ""managing expectations"" (piggy backing), while a handful of people actually knew the end-to-end solution and did the hands-on work. 
This created a lot more work and mental anguish than needed. Because of the expressed pressure, the hands-on guys have a hard time building and growing their reputation and subsequent performance evaluation rating. This also affects the project execution timelines.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you thoroughly read through your employment agreement and understand the implications. In recent years, they have started hiring for specific projects ONLY. This falls under a particular ""AMS service line"". In this case, if your assigned project gets into a problem, you are exposed to the risk of employment termination. 
Their HR and Management are very helpful, and they will try to get you a new project. But there are several constraints like location, your skills, and limited time. I went through this, and it was somewhat unnerving. This was one of the reasons I ended up leaving the company.",AMS Associate,4,Aug,2014
3,"I have been with Deloitte for a little over a year and a half now and I absolutely love it. I have provided just a few points below as to why I enjoy working at Deloitte: - Well-rounded, intelligent, and hard-working colleagues that want to see you excel in your position and career - Clear career path - Extensive growth and networking opportunities - Ability to work with incredible clients from all industries - Amazing benefits and perks (well-being subsidy, etc.) - 401K matching I also want to add that although Deloitte is a very large company, it has never felt that big to me. Everyone that I work with and have worked with in the past has been extremely communicative and responsive.","I can't think of many cons to working at Deloitte. I am in Consulting, so I think the only thing that can be tough is when you are on the bench waiting for another staffing opportunity after finishing up a client project. I'm not the most patient person, so sometimes it can be hard waiting to get that staffing confirmation for a new project.",Workday Consultant,1,Dec,2022
4,"In my experience, pay has been quite competitive coming in as an experienced hire. One pro of consulting in general is that the project-based nature of the work means that if you don't like a certain project, manager, team member, etc. there is usually a light at the end of the tunnel and you don't have to deal with it forever. Deloitte is also really trying to improve the employee experience...this has had mixed results in my experience so far - for example, rolling out the ""hybrid"" model has been great, but keeping work hours reasonable has been less so. But I do think they're trying...","There are some fundamental, structural issues at Deloitte that will make meaningful cultural improvements difficult if not impossible. These have not yet forced me to leave, partly because I am sure they exist other places as well, but may ultimately be deciding factors. 1. At a certain level, sales are rewarded above all else. What this means is that there is little accountability for leaders to actually - like, lead. The inconsistencies at the leadership (SM+) level are appalling. 2. Project margin is also highly rewarded. In practice, that means under-staffing projects. This is why work-life balance will never be a thing at Deloitte - it's just simply not incentivized. To get working hours to a consistently reasonable level, Deloitte would have to adequately staff projects, and thus make less profit, which is as likely as hell freezing over.",Senior Consultant,28,Nov,2022
5,Great pay and Benefits; Work from Home with Travel required.,"Some waiting time for a new project, or less than 40 your per week projects can cause anxiety due to the firms utilization requirements (my area requires 90%). This is almost impossible to hit annually because that is 36 hrs per week billable to a client. My current project only allows 32 hours per week maximum, so I can never hit 36 unless I have another small project requiring minimum hours, which can be hard to find. The other options is a larger 2nd project, but then you end up working 50 hours a week. In not 25 years old anymore, I have a family, and just cant work that many hours.",Consultant,4,Nov,2022
6,"Incredibly smart and caring people. Most managers are very kind people with a ton of compassion. You also have a fair bit of autonomy in determini g what projects you want to work on and how you want to guide your career, though that can be a double edged sword.","There are a lot of automated processes that you have to keep up with. Constant trainings, compliance, disclosures, and the utilization requirements can lead to a poor work life balance. On the subject of utilization, they expect 90% of your time to be billable hours, so you actually need to bill 42-45hours a week to clients to keep your utilization in good standing. This is on top of internal meetings, required trainings etc. Because you really have the freedom to define your own career, if through no fault of your own they don't have a project to staff you on it is still seen as your responsibility. Then you'll get pulled into even more meetings and even more trainings to determine how you will meet the utilization requirement.",ServiceNow Consultant,20,Oct,2022
7,Bench down time allows free time to learn or vacation Benefits are great Every project is different and you get to start over Looks great on a resume,"Company culture non existent, you go hear with a dog eat dog attitude and you progress through your own ability to network, put in LONG hours and kissing some feet Certain level consultants get no say so about what projects get assigned to them. If you get hires for a certain skill and want to build your skills, this may not be for you! The projects are backfill staffing model. This means when a project needs people, they will staff you regardless of your background and skills. I can't tell you the amount of time I spent as a PMO when I came in to do BA and Data type work. Beware: If your coach and/or resource manager are not communicative and helpful you may spend much of you time on the bench or in mismatching roles. Under utilization will result in a penalty, unwillingness to do overtime, weekends etc when requested can result in poor performance and or PIP",SAP Consultant,21,Nov,2022
8,"One of the benefits of a large company is the money being thrown around for home office enhancements, health expenses, travel expenses. Small companies don't usually have the resources like that. There's also a ton of autonomy with regard to the what, where, when, how you work on things.","If you aren't self motivated, sure, you could probably get away with doing close to nothing for the first 6-8 months.. but they'd probably let you go after that.",Technical Consultant,29,Nov,2022
9,"Deloitte has a high performing culture - and that's evident across anyone you speak to at the firm. Leadership truly values those who work here. Yes, there are plenty of perks (wellness credits, time off, disconnect days, speakers) - but the real value I see is honesty and transparency from upper management.",You work hard - all the time.

Excellent benefits, $1K annual well being subsidy, friendly/helpful people, brand recognition, opportunities to get involved both in the ESC and out, you get to work with & meet people in other business areas, and getting to go to DU. There are also tons of events and opportunities in the office to meet people in person. Most of my PPMD clients are fantastic and I've been able to develop great relationships with them from the start. I am grateful for this job and this firm!",This job can be fully remote but we are required to go into the office twice a week or face consequences. Communication from management regarding expectations should be more consistent (it seems like each manager tells their direct reports different things and this causes confusion and frustration among ECs). Transferring to other roles doesn't seem to be supported by management and they make it unnecessarily challenging to move up from an EC position even if you are qualified and have stellar performance feedback.,Executive Coordinator,21,Aug,2022
11,"Extremely fast paced; great opportunity to work with extremely talented individuals and build cutting edge solutions that make actual impact. Never have been micromanaged, but expectations are set very high. Colleagues are more than willing to help & if you apply yourself you can achieve extreme growth and valuable skillsets. I've learned far more working here vs. my days in college.","Upward growth can be challenging; if you're not putting yourself out there and performing at the top it can be tough to be recognized. Furthermore, you need to be your biggest supporter - if you want something you need to go and get it. Networking is crucial, so if that's a weak point for you then you'll need to adapt quickly outside of your comfort zone. Work life balance can be tough at times - depending on your project - but as long as you communicate well you'll be okay. You will be graded against your peers of the same level as you and the colleagues that you will work with are very driven, knowledgeable, and competitive (at times). Do your best work and you'll be fine, but if you slack off it's very easy to notice.",Product Owner,6,Sep,2022

31,"To my understanding, this is good pay for a recent post-grad and it is at a stable company where you are unlikely to lose your job during the upcoming economic turmoil. That is certainly a pro and brings peace of mind.","First, when I signed the contract with Deloitte, back when I was still in university, I was not told that I would be aligned to working on SAP day in and day out. Unfortunately, I was told about this 3 months later when it was too late to look for another job. Many people enjoy SAP and if that is you then wonderful, I happen to despise it. So, not being told about my alignment for months causes a feeling of bait and switch, there is a good chance I would not have signed had I known that. In Hindsight it can be argued this was a mistake made by a young college kid who did not know to ask for clarity on precisely what I would be doing. Nonetheless, Deloitte did a very poor job of communicating alignment. Further, now 4 months in, I have found it rather difficult to move laterally into any other aspect of consulting. The internal structure creates a feeling of being pigeonholed into wherever you are originally slotted. What I mean by this is that I am clawing tooth and nail simply to find a point of contact to help me move out of SAP. Not to actually move, but just to find someone to talk to about moving. For a company which markets itself as caring about employees more than the average, this stonewalling and difficulty in movement has come as a shock to me.",SAP Analyst,2,Nov,2022

There are a lot of different aspects of federal support that Deloitte provides, so there is something that could appeal to everyone. Deloitte's benefits are a differentiator for me, the well-being subsidy is first rate and the PTO policy is very flexible, I have never had an issue getting time off when I want or need it - people here are very understanding of work-life balance. To that point, I think they navigated flexible work well throughout the pandemic and did a really good job making sure employees were comfortable. I still work from home (very common amongst the people I speak with regularly) and Deloitte has done a lot in making it a comfortable experience.","This is specific to the Government and Public Sector (GPS) practice, but I personally find the work to be dull. The work is very mission-driven and has real world impacts to people across the US (and world), which I really like. However, the scale of the projects sometimes feel so large that it doesn't really feel like you are making as much of an impact.

For example, if a project ends and you do not have a follow up project the company places a target on your back until you find another project. It is a backwards work environment where you must find and compete for work rather than the company giving you work to do.

You really need to network to find out about anything in the company even benefits owed to you. There is no real HR and your coach is usually clueless to HR matters.

- Very talented teammates: I'm frequently blown away by how smart, nice, and hard-working my colleagues and supervisors are. Of course you will meet some rude and incompetent people, but they are the exceptions. I made some real meaningful friendships throughout my time at Deloitte
